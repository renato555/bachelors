# abstract

This paper describes deep convolutional networks and their application to the image classification problem. Special emphasis was placed on the EfficientNet family of models and the method of scaling convolutional networks introduced with them. EfficientNet, DenseNet, ResNetV2 and MobileNetV2 models were tested on standard transfer learning datasets. The obtained results were analyzed in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity.
